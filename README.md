# Digital-Dice
This is a simple text-based Python program (2.7.13).
It can be used for any game that my require Dice.
When started, it will ask the user for a "Range" for the dice, once that is input, it will generate a random number with in that range.
After each "roll" it will ask for the range for the next roll.

I've tested this on the computer and on my android phone.
I have the "QPython" app, which allows you to run Python scripts on your phone.

Hope you enjoy this or find it useful in some way.
Have a successful project.
